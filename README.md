# SecUtilsSwift

The Security framework and cryptographic functions available for iOS developers are IMHO obscure, bad documented, and thought to be used only inside iOS. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to integrate iOS in a general, heterogeneous cryptographic system due to the way the Security framework stores and retrieves the key information.

This Library makes it easier for a developer to import public keys from an external source (i.e: a backend or server, generated by OpenSSL) or exporting the generated public keys to a format readable to external sources (i.e: openSSL or PHP (i.e: openssl_get_publickey).

This library is based on CryptoExportImportManager class developed by Ignacio Nieto Carvajal (http://digitalleaves.com)

In addition to this, SecUtilsSwift gives a simple API to store passwords (secrets data like token, ...etc) 

Also, it is possible to generate keys, encrypt and descrypt with AES 256 symetric algorithm. 
This library offers, also, an api to generate RSA2048, encrypt ans decrypt with this algo. 

The couple RSA2048 and AES265 makes more secure the data communicated between server and the iOS application.
I can mention the example of secruring the payload in Push Notification.
